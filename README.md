# 100-days-of-code
Will code 1 hour for the next 100 days.


## Day 1, 8th January'19

### Today's Progress: 
Started with the freecodecamp full stack curriculum- First module, Responsive Web Design Certification. Completed the HTML module. Started the CSS module and completed half of it. 

### Thoughts: 
As I was familier with HTML, so didn't face any trouble with the module. Completed within an hour. Spent some time experimenting with differnt CSS style properties.
