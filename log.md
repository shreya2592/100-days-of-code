# 100 Days Of Code 

This time, I will be mainly focusing on freecodecamp curriculum. 

### Day 1: 28th June 2018, Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Started with the Freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Worked on the HTML5. 

**Thoughts**: I already knew most of the stuff here. But it helped me brushup the previous knowledge.
